# WellsRX Open Source Fishing Knowledge Base

## Introduction

This repository consists of a set of oilfield fishing operation procedures. The intent of this repository is to serve as a curated knowledge base for reference, scrutiny, and continuous improvement for anyone in the fishing community or the larger oilfield services industry.

### Reference
  * To serve as a base procedure to customise for specific, actual applications
  * Self-learning with verified input from experts across the industry, from various companies

### Scrutiny
  * To validate the procedures are free of errors and risks are identified and controlled
  * Aligns with best practices agreed by all regions

### Continuous Improvement
  * A platform to share lessons learned and discourage bad practices
  * Anyone can contribute corrections & suggestions so the knowledge base is always getting better

## Notes for Contributors

Each file will detail the BHA, Procedures, and Risk Assessment for each type of fishing operation. As the documents are intended as a baseline (rather as a finalized procedure for actual job planning), please note the below:
* Tool names are referred to as their Bowen name to avoid misinterpretation.
* No specific tools sizes. The procedures should be applicable to all sizes (at least in big hole applications).
* No tool connections, as this may differ widely across companies and regions.
* No information on crossovers and drillpipe, as they differ across applications.
* Avoid any company- or region-specific tools and procedures.

For larger changes (e.g. the same operation but for thru tubing applications), please suggest a new, separate file instead.

Use the standard GitHub features for any issues, suggestions, forking, and pull requests. All files should be in Markdown only.
