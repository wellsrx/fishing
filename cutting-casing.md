# Cutting Casing with Pressure Pipe Cutter

## BHA

- Taper mill
- Pressure Pipe Cutter
- Non-rotating Stabilizer
- Crossover and DP to surface

## Procedures

1. Make up the BHA as above
2. Pick up and perform function test. Take note of the GPM required to open the cutter knives. The GPM will be the minimum rate to operate the cutter downhole.
3. Secure the knives inside the pocket with duct tape to prevent them from opening and tagging on obstructions.
   > Do not use soft line, wire, or tape with elasticit, which could block the knives from opening.
4. Confirm the cut depth with the client representative. RIH to cut depth.
   > Make sure the cut depth is not at the casing collar by reviewing the casing tally. Recommended to cut approximately 1-2 m above the casing collar.
5. At cut depth, establish:
   - Pick up weight
   - Slack off weight
   - Rotating weight
   - Free rotating torque (FRT) at cutting rpm (without circulation)
6. Start rotation and slowly increase speed to the approximate cutting rpm (see table below). Fishing Supervisor shall recommend parameter adjustments as required.
  
   | Casing size to cut | Recommended starting rpm |
   | --- | --- |
   | 34" to 36" | 25 |
   | 20" to 30" | 30 to 40 |
   | 16" to 18-5/8" | 45 to 60 |
   | 9-5/8" to 13-3/8" | 60 to 70 |
   | 7" to 7-5/8" | 70 to 80 |

7.	Slowly start pump circulation and increase pump pressure as per Fishing Supervisor recommendations. Carefully monitor torque and RPM during the cutting to ensure a smooth cut is made. Do not exceed 2,000 psi SPP. Continue cutting as long as torque is noticeably higher than the FRT recorded earlier.
When the cut is complete, the knives will swing out fully and pump pressure will drop. This indicates a successful cut has been made.
9.	Optional: A further check can be made by slacking off approximately 2,000 lbs.
   > If torque is observed to be close to FRT without any cut indications, Fishing Supervisor may advise to stop and POOH after 1 hour. At surface, perform another surface test to confirm the cutter’s function.
10. Bleed off pump pressure to close knives.
11. If required, confirm casing cut via circulation through the casing cut.
12. POOH the BHA On surface, inspect knives for wear patterns to confirm the casing is cut.
13. If cutter is no longer used, secure the knives with tape and store safely.
