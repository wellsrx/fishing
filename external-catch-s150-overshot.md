# External Catch with Series 150 Overshot

## BHA

| Tool | Selection remarks |
| --- | --- |
| Series 150 Overshot | Installed with spiral or basket grapple where the range covers the fishneck OD. Non-standard guides (e.g. oversize, wallhook), extensions, and stop rings may be used depending on the fish and wellbore geometry. |
| Bumper Sub | |
| Fishing Jar | Optional. Not recommended when catch depth is shallow. |
| 2-4 joints Drill Collars | Optional, if Fishing jar is used. |
| Jar Intensifier | Optional, if Fishing jar is used. |
| Crossover / DP to surface | As per rig. |

## Procedures

1. Make up the BHA as above.
2.	RIH to near the fish. Start circulating and record the SPP. Record parameters:
    * Up weight
    * Down weight
3.	Slowly rotate the fishing string to the right (approx. 20 rpm) and gradually lower the Overshot over the fish; combined rotating and lowering is important.

    >As the Overshot engages the fish, a SPP increase may be observed. Stop pumps and bleed off any trapped pressure at surface prior to slacking off further.

4.	Allow the right-hand twist to slack out of the fishing string and then pull the fish by elevating the string to confirm engagement.
5.	Continue to increase overpull to up maximum allowable pull or fish is observed to be moving. Recommended maximum overpull is 80% of the drillstring weakest point/connection.

    >If the fish does not come, turn on the circulating pumps and maintain an upward strain while circulation is forced through the fish.

    >Unless an upward strain is maintained, never rotate the fishing string to the left while the Overshot is engaged with the fish.

6.	If the fish is still not free, and fishing jar is available, attempt to jar. Set the string down to ensure the fishing jar is closed. Then, raise the string, applying the desired pull load at the jar (do not exceed the maximum pull load as above). Set the brake and wait for the jar to strike. Close the jar and repeat until the fish is free.

    >Use caution when applying pull load to the jar. Do not exceed the safe working load for the jar being used. Refer to the specific jar manual.

9. Additional blows might be required to move the fish. Repeat jarring with increased tension in the string.
10.	POOH at a controlled rate and do not rotate the string. Secure the fish at rig floor.
11.	Release the Overshot by bumping down the Bumper Sub then simultaneously rotate to the right and slowly elevate the fishing string until the overshot is clear of the fish; combined rotating and elevating is important.
12.	Lay down the overshot BHA.
13.	Proceed to lay down the fish at rig floor.
