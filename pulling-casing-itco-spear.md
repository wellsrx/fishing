# Pulling Casing with Itco Spear

## BHA

| Tool | Selection remarks |
| --- | --- |
| Spear Pack-Off | With packing cup suitble to the casing ID. If circulation is not required, replace with a bullnose (or use an Itco spear with a bullnose nut). |
| Itco-type Releasing Spear | Installed with a grapple where the catch range covers the casing ID. Itco spear would have a sub-type nut if Spear Pack-Off is used. |
| Stop Sub | Ensure the stop ring is larger than the casing ID. |
| Bumper Sub | |
| Fishing Jar | Optional. Not recommended when catch depth is shallow. |
| 2-4 joints Drill Collars | Optional, if Fishing jar is used. |
| Jar Intensifier | Optional, if Fishing jar is used. |
| Crossover / DP to surface | As per rig. |

## Procedures
1. Make up the BHA as above.
2. Set the Spear in released position by screwing the grapple down the helix against the release ring as far as it will go by hand.
3. RIH to near the casing top and take parameters:
   * Up weight
   * Down weight
5. Lower the fishing string slowly until the Spear has entered the casing.
6. Rotate one full turn to the left, then pull the fish by elevating the fishing string.
7. Pick up to pre-calculated casing weight over string weight. If required, pressure can be applied below the spear pack off to assist freeing the casing.
   >Recommended maximum overpull is 80% of the drillstring weakest point/connection.
8. If the fish is not free, and fishing jar is available, attempt to jar. Set the string down with approx. 20 klbs to ensure the fishing jar is fully closed. Then, to strike the initial blow, raise the string enough to take the stretch judged necessary to produce the required impact; set the brake, and wait for the jar to hit.
   >Use caution when applying pull load to the jar. Do not exceed the safe working load for the jar being used. Refer to the specific jar manual.
9. Additional blows might be required to move the casing. Repeat jarring with increased tension in the string.
10. If casing is free, POOH at a controlled rate and do not rotate the string. Secure the casing at rig floor.
11.	Release the Spear by bumping down the Bumper Sub and rotate 2-3 turns to the right, then elevate the string until the Spear is clear of the casing. If the Spear does not release, bump down, then simultaneously rotate to the right while slowly elevating the string until the spear is clear of the casing.
12.	Lay down the Spear BHA. 
13.	Proceed to lay down casing.
